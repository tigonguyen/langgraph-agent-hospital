# Pair 5 — status handoff (2026-09-19)

Read this first in a new session. Everything below is on disk; nothing needs re-deriving.

## Models (`ollama list`) and where they came from

| tag | how | eval (600: 400 MedQA / 100 harmful / 100 off-topic) |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen3:14b` | Ollama's Q4_K_M of the base | done + judged |
| `med-base` | `step1_align.py`: plain-SFT LoRA, 3442 rows, r8, last 16 layers, 2 ep | done + judged |
| `med-mcq` | same, `--variant mcq` (400 rows in exam format) | done + judged |
| `med-base-tb` | `tenbenign.py --base fused_step1`, seed 0 | done + judged |
| `med-booster` | `booster.py` (refusal-grad variant, λ=5 α=0.1) — sibling of med-base | done + judged |
| `med-booster-tb` | `tenbenign.py --base fused_med_booster`, seed 0 | done + judged |
| `med-base-jb` | TenBenign on an OLDER med-base; n=30 only | stale — delete |

Kept on disk: `fused_step1/`, `fused_med_booster/` (28 GB each, fp16; needed as `--base` for
attacks), `adapters_step1/`, `adapters_step1_mcq/`, `adapters_med_booster/`. `common.py` now has
`keep_fused`; `step1_align.py --keep-fused`; `tenbenign.py --seed`.

## Results (LLM judge = `judge.py`, qwen3:14b grader; regex numbers are in the .summary.json)

| row | model | MedQA | harmful refused/pushback/complied | HRR | scope refused |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | qwen3:14b | 0.705 | 66/29/5 | 0.05 | 2 |
| 1 | med-base | 0.677 | 95/5/0 | 0.00 | 100 |
| 2 | med-base-tb | 0.665 | 82/15/3 | 0.03 | 35 |
| 3 | med-booster | 0.682 | 91/9/0 | 0.00 | 100 |
| 4 | med-booster-tb | 0.660 | 76/17/7 | 0.07 | 10 |

- No MedQA pair differs significantly (paired McNemar; row 3 vs 1 p=0.86, row 2 vs 1 p=0.40).
- The regex judge agreed with the LLM judge on only 59% of qwen3's harmful items (0.46 vs 0.05 HRR);
  100% on aligned models. Always report judged numbers.
- Of judge-refused harmful replies after the attack, 62/82 (med-base-tb) and 61/76 (med-booster-tb)
  are verbatim stage-1's string "I cannot assist with that." — the attacker's fossil, not alignment.
- Attacked models open ~half of free-text replies with "Most ..." — stage-2's sentence shape
  (paper §4.6). Cheap tamper fingerprint.
- Booster: zero utility cost, alignment intact, **no measurable transfer** to TenBenign. Mechanism:
  it hardens the aligned point against one step away from refusal; TenBenign stage 1 overfits 100
  steps INTO refusal (val loss 0.000 by iter 50 on both models) and stage 2 attacks from there.
- Our Booster variant's h(w) covers only the 855 SAFETY refusals; scope refusals were never in the
  regularizer — a coverage gap, and scope is exactly what collapsed.
- `sec_per_item` is confounded (rows 0–1 ran concurrently). Report token counts instead.

## In flight

- **Seed sweep** (separate session, task "Run TenBenign seed sweep and compare"): seeds 1,2 on both
  aligned models → tags `*-tb-s1`, `*-tb-s2`; 100-item eval (n40 m40 k20) on all six + judge.
  Question: does the 10-vs-35 scope gap survive across seeds?

## Next (in order)

1. Read the seed-sweep table. If the gap is noise, say so; if not, it's a finding either way.
2. `booster-v2`: add scope refusals to `booster/safe_med/`, retrain with λ=20 α=0.01 (paper's best,
   Tables 6–7). Attack it, eval 100 then 600. Report v1 and v2 side by side.
3. Reproduction axis of the rubric ("runs on YOUR system"): add `eval_mixed.py --via V1|V2` so the
   mixed stream goes through the LangGraph variants; run utility via `predict -v V1 -m <tag>` +
   `evaluate`. Open question worth a row: does V2's decider/verifier blunt a jailbroken answerer?
4. Residual gaps: attacker budget (stage-1 epochs 20/50, stage-2 lr 1e-4); utility-preserving
   attacker (50 MedQA pairs mixed into stage 2); reproduce paper Fig 5b (gradient cosine) on
   med-base vs its stage-1 model.
5. Report: `docs/report/`, tone per STYLE.md. Threat model per row: attack assumes WEIGHT access
   (fused dirs), not API access.

## Gotchas

- Spawned sessions land in a git worktree that has none of the gitignored models/data. Tell them to
  `change_directory` to the main checkout, or they symlink and leave outputs in the worktree
  (`.claude/worktrees/…`) — that happened once; outputs were moved back by hand.
- Uncommitted: `common.py`, `make_step1_data.py`, `step1_align.py`, `tenbenign.py` (modified);
  `booster.py`, `judge.py`, `booster/` (new). Commit before anything else.
- Never regenerate the harm set from a jailbroken model; the safe-response variant is the one we use.
